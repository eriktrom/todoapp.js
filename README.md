A remake of the emberjs todo app from emberjs.com, with a focus on testing and javascript build tools.


Make it Go
==========
1. `npm install --save-dev`
2. `grunt server`
3. Go to [localhost:8000/test](localhost:8000/test) (turn on livereload in your browser for best experience)

Feel free to tell me I'm doing it wrong or just chat by making an issue, or head to this post on the ember discuss forum: [Ember-testing without Rails 3.2 ](http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-testing-without-rails-3-2/1409), which is what prompted me to upload this repo in the first place.
